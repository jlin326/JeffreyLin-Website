        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music ProducerðŸŽµ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi everyone, welcome to my website. My name is Jeffrey Lin, and I am 18 years old. I am a freshman at UCR and am currently studying Political Science. My ethnicity is Taiwanese, and I was born in Taiwan on November 20, 2002. I have a younger brother, an older brother, and 3 older sisters. I am a Christian and have been going to church ever since I was 5 (Not recently due to Covid). My hobbies include drawing, playing music, and singing. Because of my Christian background, I have been singing for almost all of my life. I grew to enjoy music on an intricate and emotional level. I aspire to become a music producer/singer and hope I can gradually become somewhat successful. I have sung for the worship team a couple of times, so I have somewhat of an experience of singing under pressure. Even though this is the case, I still have a hard time performing in front of people if I am the main focus. I have minor stage-freight, and I get extremely nervous when the spotlight is on me. I am constantly trying to overcome this fear and hope I can grow to become more confident while pursuing my dream.<br><br>

        For musical instruments, I can play both the piano and guitar, but I have a greater advantage at piano because of my experience with the instrument for over 10 years. Ever since the pandemic, I have gotten much more free time to pursue this dream. I really like pop and R&B music, so I would try to make my own covers and post them so my friends could see. I am always trying to listen to new music and see what I like depending on how I feel about the music. I would look for YouTube tutorials on how to play the song chords so that I would be able to play music while singing. I also got into using music DAW softwares, especially Audacity, and I would also look up tutorials and how to use it. I learned the basics of the DAW, learning how to use reverb, cutting out noise, and many more intricate details.<br><br>

        As much as I love singing and playing music, I also love to listen to music. Whenever I am feeling down, happy, or moderate, I can always put on headphones and just listen to music. My favorite artist is Charlie Puth and Jeremy Zucker, which are a few artists that influenced me to want to chase this dream. Listening to music just helps get me to be productive, and also help with the mood of whatever I am doing. Music has been a big part of my life, and I hope I can continue to make it special to me. I hope to make this dream become reality, and hopefully, one day, listen to my own music.
